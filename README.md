# Netflix-Stock-Price-Time-Series
## Overview
The Project analyse Netflix historical stock price data from 2010 to 2020 and predicts the future year stock price. The dataset is available in google finance or [here](https://www.kaggle.com/prestonfan/netflix-stock-prices). AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Facebook Prophet and Longshort-term memory (LSTM) were implemented to analysis and predict the future year stock price. 

## Motivation
I am a movie-freak. I love to watch movies and web series. Netflix is creating a revolution in the field of streaming web series and movies.  Recently I was watching a conference of Pydata on youtube about time series prediction. That conference motivates me to work on a time series model.  So I thought it would be fun and exciting to work on Netflix stock price
